Adds a button to the WordPress TinyMCE editor to clear floats.

== Description ==

Adds a button to the WordPress TinyMCE editor to clear floats.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress “Plugins” screen
2. Activate the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which HTML markup does the plugin use ? =

Until version 1.1, the following markup has been used: `<div style="clear: (left|right|both);"></div>`.
From version 1.2.0 on, the following markup is used: `<br style="clear: both;" />` (line breaks).
> Note: TinyMCE wrapps line breaks in paragraphs which may lead to additional margins depending on your theme. To prevent these margins paste the following in the “Custom CSS” part of the Customizer:
`p > br[style="clear: both;"]:only-child {
	content: '';
	display: block;
	margin-bottom: -1.5em;
}`
The value `1.5em` corresponds to your theme’s `margin-bottom` of `<p>` tags.

== Screenshots ==

1. Before: Floated images in the editor. The second image overlaps the first.
2. After: Added clear tag (see new icon in second toolbar).
3. Markup in the Text Editor (notice `<br style="clear: both;" />`).
